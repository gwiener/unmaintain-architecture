# How to Design an Unmaintainable Architecture

It's been a while since Roedy Green's classical [How To Write Unmaintainable Code](https://www.mindprod.com/jgloss/unmain.html).
The software world has changed. A software project nowadays consist not only of code, but also of cloud-allocated resources,
deployment scripts, build pipelines, security policies, API configurations - A whole new world of mission-critical details.
Some of these facilities not only help run your application, but also protect it from errors and glitches, 
making programs *easier* to maintain! Therefore, as a software architect, your job security depends not only on preventing any
maintenance programmer from changing your code, but also making sure none of those code pups could ever update your deployment plan.

As a service to the community, we offer this compiled collection of obfuscation techniques, so that our fellow senior developers could
maintain their exagguratedly high-paying jobs forever. Feel free to contribute by sending a Pull Request!
